In order to check if my waves were correct, I plotted them in MATLAB and compared them to the waveform.eps file. The final error value is 2.482263E-8.

The extra wave sounds similar to a triangle wave, but it starts at the highest point and goes to the lowest within the first 250,000 microseconds. Once it reaches the lowest point, it reverses and goes back to the highest point so that by 500,000 micro seconds (half a second) the wave forms an upside down triangle. In the next quarter of a second, the wave reverses from the high point and reverses again from the midpoint. With only 250,000 microseconds left in the second and the wave being at the highest point, it reveses once more to repeat the initial sound and goes to the lowest point. At 1,000,000 microseconds, the wave (which ended at the lowest point) restarts at the highest.
